The logic pertaining to fileting out people resides in Planner.java class.
All the other java classes are the surrounding helper classes.
The entire code has been programmed to mimic real world instances.
I tested the logic using karate neworking data. 
More details of this data could be found at - http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~jiashun/Research/software/NetworkData/Karate/
Tested the karate network using different cutoff criteria values (like 3 friends, 4 friends and 5 friends).
The code includes comments to walk you through the logic.
The entire pipeline can be run from Driver.java class.
If you wish to test the program further (using your inputs), you could do so by 
creating Person and Pair objects and by passing them to Planner.java class as inputs (list).
